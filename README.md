Plugin was used as an intermediate element between plasma cutting CNC and custom torch height controlling (THC) device. To pair them one need to route some specific signals from and to THC. Also, manual plasma cutter was attached to the CNC with a custom made Z-movement axis so we were been in need to supply some driver. All this is done by this plugin.

Circuit diagram and PCB were developed in EasyEDA online tool.
